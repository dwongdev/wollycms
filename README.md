# SpacelyCMS

A self-hosted, open-source headless CMS designed for [Astro.js](https://astro.build) with composable block-based page building, reusable content blocks, and hierarchical menu management.

## Vision

SpacelyCMS fills the gap between simple headless CMS tools (Strapi, Directus) that lack page composition, and expensive SaaS platforms (Storyblok) that lock you in. It brings Drupal's powerful content composition model — paragraphs, reusable blocks, multi-region layouts — into a modern, lightweight, Astro-native package.

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Block Composition** — Build pages from typed, reusable content blocks arranged in named regions (main, sidebar, bottom)
- **Reusable Block Library** — Create blocks once, reference them across pages. Edit once, update everywhere.
- **Hierarchical Menus** — Multiple menus with deep nesting, container items, and drag-drop editing
- **Astro-Native** — First-class `@spacelycms/astro` integration with BlockRenderer, route generation, menu helpers, and image optimization
- **Self-Hosted** — Runs anywhere Node.js runs. SQLite for dev, PostgreSQL for production.
- **Webmaster-Friendly** — Admin UI with WYSIWYG editing, media library, and visual page builder
- **Host Anywhere** — Works with Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, Netlify, VPS, Docker — any Astro deployment target

## Status

🚧 **Pre-development** — Architecture and planning phase. See `/docs` for detailed specifications.
