# Changelog

All notable changes to WollyCMS are documented here.

WollyCMS is pre-1.0. The API surface may change between releases.

## Unreleased

## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-31

### Added
- Astro 7 support in `@wollycms/astro`, while retaining Astro 5 and 6 compatibility.
- Scheduled publish and unpublish processing on Cloudflare Workers.
- Block category metadata in the content schema and Astro types.
- A staging deployment workflow for validating CMS releases before production.
- Published package READMEs, licenses, bundled starter templates, and package-entry validation.

### Changed
- Node.js 22 LTS is now the supported server, CLI, CI, and Docker runtime.
- Updated Hono, the Hono Node adapter, Drizzle, Sharp, SvelteKit tooling, Vitest, and other runtime dependencies.
- `create-wolly` now scaffolds `@wollycms/server ^0.3.0` and the versioned GHCR image.
- The example college site now uses Astro 7.

### Fixed
- Rich-text image sizes are preserved when editing legacy content.
- Rich-text image and table toolbars remain sticky inside repeaters and long editors.
- Rich-text links preserve CSS class and `rel` attributes, table cells align to the top, and text alignment renders correctly.
- Content API schema fields are normalized consistently across SQLite, PostgreSQL, and D1.
- Worker globals are included in server TypeScript builds.
- External preview iframes are permitted by the admin CSP.
- The published Astro image component now exports `SpacelyImage.astro`; the former `WollyImage.astro` entry remains as a compatibility alias.
- Starter templates are included in the `create-wolly` npm tarball.

### Security
- Dependency updates remove all known critical and high-severity findings from the root production package audit at release preparation time.

## 0.2.5 - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- Admin CSP handling for Node-mode npm installations.

### Security
- **API key permissions enforced** — Keys map to roles based on stored permissions (`content:read` → viewer, `content:write` → editor, `*` → admin).
- **JWT secret enforcement** — Node.js production startup fails if `JWT_SECRET` is missing or uses the development default.
- **Webhook SSRF hardening** — DNS resolution checks block private-IP rebinding, redirects are rejected, and the CGNAT range is blocked.
- **Rate limiter** — Prefers `CF-Connecting-IP` over spoofable `X-Forwarded-For`.
