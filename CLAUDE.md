# SpacelyCMS — Project Instructions

## Project Overview

SpacelyCMS is a self-hosted, open-source headless CMS designed for Astro.js.
It provides composable block-based page building with reusable content blocks,
hierarchical menus, taxonomy management, and media handling.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js 22 LTS, TypeScript (strict mode, ESM)
- **API Framework**: Hono 4.x
- **ORM**: Drizzle (SQLite default, PostgreSQL supported)
- **Admin UI**: SvelteKit (SPA mode)
- **Rich Text**: TipTap (JSON storage format)
- **Media**: Sharp for image processing
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Package Management**: npm workspaces (monorepo)

## Project Structure

```
packages/server/    — Hono API server + Drizzle schema + media processing
packages/admin/     — SvelteKit admin UI
packages/astro/     — @spacelycms/astro npm integration package
examples/           — Reference Astro site
docs/               — Architecture and planning documentation
scripts/            — Build, deploy, migration scripts
```

## Build Commands

```bash
npm install               # Install all workspace dependencies
npm run dev               # Start server with hot reload (tsx watch)
npm run build             # Build all packages
npm run test              # Run Vitest tests
npm run db:generate       # Generate Drizzle migration from schema changes
npm run db:migrate        # Run pending migrations
npm run db:seed           # Populate database with sample data
```

## Test Commands

```bash
npm run test                                   # Run all tests
npm run test --workspace=packages/server       # Server tests only
```

## Current Status

- **Phases 1-4**: Complete (Data + API, Astro Integration, Admin UI, Visual Page Builder + Live Preview)
- **Phase 5**: Not started (Production Hardening + Migration Tools)
- Monorepo: npm workspaces (packages/server, packages/admin, packages/astro, examples/college-site)
- Database: 13 tables with full Drizzle schema + indexes + migrations
- Seed data: 8 pages, 10 block types (incl. hero), 3 content types, 3 menus, 2 taxonomies
- Content API: 9 endpoints including preview (97 tests passing: 27 content + 70 admin)
- Schema files use `.ts` imports (not `.js`) for drizzle-kit compatibility
- App factory: `src/app.ts` (testable), `src/index.ts` (server entry)

## Architecture Key Points

- Content is stored as structured JSON (not HTML)
- Pages have named regions (hero, content, sidebar, bottom, features) containing ordered blocks
- Hero content is a composable block type in the hero region (not page-level fields)
- Blocks can be inline (page-specific) or shared/reusable (from block library)
- TipTap rich text stored as JSON, rendered by Astro components
- Content API is public/read-only; Admin API is authenticated; Preview API is token-authenticated
- Media stored on local filesystem (dev) or S3-compatible (prod)
- API routes: `/api/content/*` (public), `/api/admin/*` (auth), `/api/content/preview/*` (token auth)

## Important Patterns

- Use Zod schemas for all API input validation
- Drizzle schema is the single source of truth for database structure
- Block type schemas are JSON — define field types, validation, and UI hints
- All timestamps are ISO 8601 UTC
- Slugs are auto-generated from titles, manually overridable, unique enforced
- Shared blocks track references — cannot be deleted while in use
